# Hospital Management â€“ Task 2 (DML Operations)

## Overview
This task involves inserting, updating, and deleting data using SQL DML statements on the hospital database created in Task 1.

We also demonstrate how to handle:
- `NULL` values
- `DEFAULT` constraints
- `NOT NULL` violations (commented)
- Partial inserts (specific columns only)

---

## What This Includes
- **INSERT INTO** statements for major tables
- Handling **NULLs** and **Defaults**
- Use of **UPDATE** with `WHERE` conditions
- Use of **DELETE** safely
- Examples of:
  - `IS NULL`
  - Transaction rollback (commented)

---

## How to Run
1. Open your MySQL Workbench or DB Fiddle.
2. Ensure your schema from Task 1 is created.
3. Run the script in `task2.sql`.
